# Beyond the Basics: Istio

[Istio](https://istio.io/) is an open platform to connect, secure, control and observe microservices, also known as a service mesh. With Istio, You can manage network traffic, load balance across microservices, enforce access policies, verify service identity, secure service communication and observe what exactly is going on with your services.

## Objectives

After you complete this course, you'll be able to:

* Download and install Istio in your cluster
* Deploy the Guestbook sample app
* Use metrics, logging and tracing to observe services
* Set up the Istio Ingress Gateway
* Perform simple traffic management, such as A/B tests and canary deployments
* Secure your service mesh
* Enforce policies for your microservices

## Prerequisites

1. Kubernetes cluster
2. Basic understanding of containers, Kubernetes, and Istio.
